# Local environment setup

To run the server, install Bun.

`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

You can then run the server through the following command:

`npm run run-server`

Which should start the Express server on port 3001. Navigate to /index.html to see the tennis
dashboard.

You'll also need to configure your .env so that you can correctly connect to the database. See
the .env.example for the values that you'll need to provide.
